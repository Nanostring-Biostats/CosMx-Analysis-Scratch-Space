# CosMx Analysis Scratch Space

This repo is here to accelerate analysis of CosMx datasets. It contains code and writeups addressing challenges we've faced in analyzing CosMx data. After dozens of analyses, we have developed a sense of what works and what doesn't, and we have developed (sometimes partial) solutions for many frequent problems.
