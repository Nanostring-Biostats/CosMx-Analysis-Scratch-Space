# Basic CosMx analysis workflow

## Introduction

This directory contains a complete demo analysis of a CosMx dataset. 
It's intended to be used as a template for other analyses to follow. 

We'll be analyzing a 6000-plex dataset from a _______.
We begin with the files written by the AtoMx flat file export module. 
The full dataset we've used is too big to be saved on Github. 
To follow along, we recommend using your own data, also as output by the AtoMx flat file export module.

## File structure

We'll organize the files for this analysis as follows:

```insert snapshot of the folders```

- The "raw_data" folder holds the exports from AtoMx
- "processed_data" holds data objects generated during analysis, meant to be used by later analyses. 
- "results" holds results intended for human consumption.
