## Introduction

Perhaps the most useful analysis we can perform with this data is to study how cells
change in response to their *spatial context*. 
Here some expertise/taste is required: how we define spatial context should depend on
our understanding our how our tissues are spatially organized and on the biological questions we 
want to answer. 

There are two general approaches we can employ:

1. Unsupervised: use clustering algorithms to partition our tissues into distinct "niches"/ "spatial clusters". 
2. Hypothesis-driven: use custom code to define variables you care about. Examples: distance to nearest 
tumor cell, number of tumor cells in neighborhood, neighborhood expression level of a given cytokine, 
in/out of a substructure (e.g. TLS in a tumor, glomeruli in kidneys...).

## Spatial clustering

Quite a few algorithms now exist for spatial clustering, many quite complex. 
Be warned that some of these become computationally intractable with the very large datasets now routinely produced by spatial platforms. 
We find that a simple, computationally quick approach works well: we record the cell type composition of each cell's neighborhood,
and we cluster cells based on these values. 
Alternatively, we can cluster cells based on the mean expression profile of their neighborhoods. 

```{r spatialclust}

```

## Hand-defining spatial context

Here we present three ways to annotate cells based on their spatial context:

- Distance to a cell type
- Number of neighbors of a cell type
- Neighborhood expression of a gene
