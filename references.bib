	abstract = {Accurate cell typing is fundamental to analysis of spatial single-cell transcriptomics, but legacy scRNA-seq algorithms can underperform in this new type of data. We have developed a cell typing algorithm, Insitutype, designed for statistical and computational efficiency in spatial transcriptomics data.Insitutype is based on a likelihood model that weighs the evidence from every expression value, extracting all the information available in each cell{\textquoteright}s expression profile. This likelihood model underlies a Bayes classifier for supervised cell typing, and an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for unsupervised and semi-supervised clustering. Insitutype also leverages alternative data types collected in spatial studies, such as cell images and spatial context, by using them to inform prior probabilities of cell type calls. We demonstrate rapid clustering of millions of cells and accurate fine-grained cell typing of kidney and non-small cell lung cancer samples.Competing Interest StatementPD, EZ, ZY, DR, MG, ZR, TKK, SH, DH and JMB are current/former employees and shareholders of NanoString.},

   abstract = {Resolving the spatial distribution of RNA and protein in tissues at subcellular resolution is a challenge in the field of spatial biology. We describe spatial molecular imaging, a system that measures RNAs and proteins in intact biological samples at subcellular resolution by performing multiple cycles of nucleic acid hybridization of fluorescent molecular barcodes. We demonstrate that spatial molecular imaging has high sensitivity (one or two copies per cell) and very low error rate (0.0092 false calls per cell) and background (~0.04 counts per cell). The imaging system generates three-dimensional, super-resolution localization of analytes at ~2 million cells per sample. Cell segmentation is morphology based using antibodies, compatible with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples. We measured multiomic data (980 RNAs and 108 proteins) at subcellular resolution in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues (nonsmall cell lung and breast cancer) and identified >18 distinct cell types, ten unique tumor microenvironments and 100 pairwise ligand-receptor interactions. Data on >800,000 single cells and ~260 million transcripts can be accessed at http://nanostring.com/CosMx-dataset .},

   abstract = {Spatial omics data are advancing the study of tissue organization and cellular communication at an unprecedented scale. Flexible tools are required to store, integrate and visualize the large diversity of spatial omics data. Here, we present Squidpy, a Python framework that brings together tools from omics and image analysis to enable scalable description of spatial molecular data, such as transcriptome or multivariate proteins. Squidpy provides efficient infrastructure and numerous analysis methods that allow to efficiently store, manipulate and interactively visualize spatial omics data. Squidpy is extensible and can be interfaced with a variety of already existing libraries for the scalable analysis of spatial omics data.},

Here we present Giotto, a comprehensive and open-source toolbox for spatial data analysis and visualization. The analysis module provides end-to-end analysis by implementing a wide range of algorithms for characterizing tissue composition, spatial expression patterns, and cellular interactions. Furthermore, single-cell RNAseq data can be integrated for spatial cell-type enrichment analysis. The visualization module allows users to interactively visualize analysis outputs and imaging features.
