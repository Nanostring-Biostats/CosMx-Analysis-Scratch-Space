Keeping track of our newest posts should be easier now that we have enabled RSS feeds. It's a great way to stay up-to-date on Scratch Space and any other blog you follow. It's also super easy to set up. 

Step 1: Click the RSS feed icon on the upper right of this post.



```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("./figures/rss-1.png")
```


Step 2: Select your method (_e.g._, [Feeder](https://feeder.co/){target='_blank'}).

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("./figures/rss-2.png")
```

And that's it! When you navigate to your RSS reader, you should see "Blog" along with your other RSS feeds.
