description: Regions of Interests (ROIs) have a variety of uses when analyzing spatial data. This blog post shows you how to select ROIs with `napari-cosmx` and some of the downstream things you can do with those ROIs.

# Introduction



## Prerequisites

- reference the other post on getting started here. Note that this is for the 
"intermediate" napari-cosmx user as we'll be working with python code

## The Example Dataset

- talk about the example dataset that we'll be working with (check with Prajan to see
if the breast cancer dataset or the CRC dataset are the most useful here)
- Do we need to do any pre-processing (like cell typing) with said dataset?

# Defining ROIs

## Keybindings!

## Filtering cells based on ROIs

# Saving and Retreiving ROIs

# Selecting Individual cells

## looping through cells and taking screenshots

# Conclusions
