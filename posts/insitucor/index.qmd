# Background 

We developed the InSituCor algorithm to assist in exploratory analysis of spatial transcriptomics,
based on the observation that spatially correlated genes often reveal new biological relationships.
We have found it to be a consistently useful tool for discovering unexpected relationships in CosMx data.

InSituCor makes one important contribution to the spatial correlation field: it isolates 
correlations that can't be explained by the cell type landscape alone.
